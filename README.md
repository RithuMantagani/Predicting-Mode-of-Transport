# Predicting-Mode-of-Transport
Machine Learning Project
This project requires you to understand what mode of transport employees prefers to commute to their office. The attached data 'Cars.csv' includes employee information about their mode of transport as well as their personal and professional details like age, salary, work exp. We need to predict whether or not an employee will use Car as a mode of transport. Also, which variables are a significant predictor behind this decision?

Data Dictionary

Age	Age of the Employee in Years
Gender	Gender of the Employee
Engineer	For Engineer =1 , Non Engineer =0
MBA	For MBA =1 , Non MBA =0
Work Exp	Experience in years
Salary	Salary in Lakhs per Annum
Distance	Distance in Kms from Home to Office
license	If Employee has Driving Licence -1, If not, then 0
Transport	Mode of Transport
